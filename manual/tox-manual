[1] Description: tox aims to automate and standardize testing in Python.
It is part of a larger vision of easing the packaging, testing and release process of Python software.
 - checking your package installs correctly with different Python versions and interpreters
 - running your tests in each of the environments, configuring your test tool of choice
 - acting as a frontend to Continuous Integration servers, greatly reducing boilerplate and merging CI and shell-based testing.

First, install tox with pip install tox. Then put basic information about your project and the test environments you
want your project to run in into a tox.ini file residing right next to your setup.py file:

# content of: tox.ini , put in same dir as setup.py
[tox]
envlist = py26,py27
[testenv]
deps=pytest       # install pytest in the venvs
commands=pytest  # or 'nosetests' or ...
